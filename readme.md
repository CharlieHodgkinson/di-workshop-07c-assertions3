### Solving Tests
Type ```npm install``` on your terminal or the repl.it terminal to install mocha.
Look at the exercise files. Your goal is to complete the exercises in sequence by getting the tests to pass. You can try the tests using ```npm test```. See the instructions in the test files.

### Saving tests
The workshop will be set up to allow you to save your changes.
For this, you should use ```git add .``` to 'stage' all files, i.e. prepare them to be committed, git ```git commit -m "MESSAGE HERE"``` to register the changes, then ```git push origin master``` to save your changes to the server. You should get into the habit of doing this after every completed exercise.
